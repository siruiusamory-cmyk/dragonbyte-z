# Changelog

Notable changes to what a visitor or user of this project can see.

### Save catalogue

- The catalogue indexes the recomp harness's `.state0` checkpoints as savestates,
  records the frame, map and coordinates its `index.json` gives each one, and
  names the game from the digest of a ROM above it.
- Roots can be kept in the store's own `roots.txt` with `scan --add-root`, so a
  plain `scan` covers the scratch directories this machine writes states into.
- `audit` lists every save or state file the index does not hold, prints
  `UNINDEXED <n>`, and exits 1 until the next `scan`.

### Public progress site

- Redesigned the progress site as a Frutiger Aero desktop. Each section opens
  in its own glass window, a taskbar links to every window, and sidebar
  gadgets show the buildout meter, the per-family tallies, the next phase and
  three headline measurements.
- The capability index and the latest verified wins are forum-style lists whose
  rows expand to show their detail; the roadmap to 1.0 reads as a thread with
  one post per phase.
- New hand-drawn wallpaper and icon set; every figure on the page is still
  derived from the capability registry and the project status data.
- All text meets WCAG AA contrast, interactive targets are at least 24 px tall,
  and the layout stacks into one column on phones without horizontal scrolling.

### Follow-up fixes

- The roadmap now shows Phase 3, graphics and actor authoring, as in progress,
  since graphics import has shipped; the desktop gadget reads "Working on now".
- Keyboard and reading order now follow the window layout, the taskbar no
  longer covers a focused element at the bottom of the screen, and the
  screenshot's caption is attached to its figure.
- On narrow screens the taskbar fades at its edge to show that more windows
  scroll into view.
- The taskbar is built from the site's navigation data, the wallpaper follows
  the configured base path, and a roadmap line marked as shipped without the
  expected separator now stops the build instead of rendering as planned.

### README

- Corrected the current status to the registry's 21 / 24 (88%), with AUTHOR
  4 / 7, and named the next capability after graphics import shipped.
